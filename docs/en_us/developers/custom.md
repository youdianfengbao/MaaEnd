# Development Manual - Custom Actions and Recognition Reference

`Custom` is used to invoke custom logic registered on the project side within a Pipeline. It is divided into two categories:

- `Custom Action`: Executes action logic, such as subtask scheduling, state cleanup, and complex interactions.
- `Custom Recognition`: Executes recognition logic, returns whether it matches, and optionally provides detailed recognition results.

Go implementations in the project are typically located under `agent/go-service/` and are registered via:

- `maa.AgentServerRegisterCustomAction(...)`
- `maa.AgentServerRegisterCustomRecognition(...)`

---

## Custom Action

Action nodes are used to execute custom actions. A common format is as follows:

```json
{
    "action": "Custom",
    "custom_action": "SomeAction",
    "custom_action_param": {
        "foo": "bar"
    }
}
```

- `custom_action`: The registration name.
- `custom_action_param`: An arbitrary JSON value, serialized by the framework and passed to the implementation side.

### SubTask

The `SubTask` implementation is located in `agent/go-service/subtask` and is used to execute a series of subtasks sequentially.

- Parameters:
    - `sub: string[]`: required list of subtask names.
    - `continue?: bool`: whether to continue after a subtask fails. Default is `false`.
    - `strict?: bool`: whether the current action should fail when a subtask fails. Default is `true`.
    - `random_choice?: int`: if set and greater than `0`, the `sub` list is shuffled and at most this many subtasks are picked to run; values exceeding the list length are clamped to it. Defaults to running every subtask in order.

    Before the random pick, subtask nodes in `sub` that cannot be resolved or whose `enabled` is `false` are filtered out (a node without an explicit `enabled` counts as enabled). If no runnable subtask remains after filtering (and the random pick), the action is not treated as a failure: it logs a single warning and returns success.

Example file: [`SubTask.json`](../../../assets/resource/pipeline/Interface/Example/SubTask.json)

### FailureCollector

`FailureCollector` is implemented in `agent/go-service/common/failurecollector`. It collects failures across multiple subtasks and reports overall failure only after all subtasks finish. An individual subtask failure does not interrupt subsequent subtasks.

Three Custom Actions are provided, linked into one collection by a shared `key`:

- `FailureCollectorReset`: Resets the collection state for the given `key`. Must be called before all RunTask invocations.
- `FailureCollectorRunTask`: Runs the subtask specified by `task`. On success, proceeds normally; on failure, records `failure_task` in occurrence order and optionally runs `recovery_task`. The Action itself always returns success so the Pipeline continues.
- `FailureCollectorFinish`: Runs every recorded `failure_task` node in failure order, then clears the state. Returns failure when any failures were recorded, success otherwise.

- Parameters:
    - `FailureCollectorReset`:
        - `key: string`: Collection identifier. Required. Must be consistent and globally unique within the same flow.
    - `FailureCollectorRunTask`:
        - `key: string`: Collection identifier. Required.
        - `task: string`: The subtask Pipeline node to run. Required. When the target node is disabled (`Enabled = false`), it is skipped and not treated as a failure.
        - `failure_task: string`: The Pipeline node recorded on failure. Required. This node typically uses `focus` to surface a user-visible message through the Agent.
        - `recovery_task?: string`: A recovery task node to run after a failure. Optional.
    - `FailureCollectorFinish`:
        - `key: string`: Collection identifier. Required.

Example file: [`AutoCollect.json`](../../../assets/resource/pipeline/AutoCollect.json)

### ClearHitCount

The `ClearHitCount` implementation is located in `agent/go-service/clearhitcount` and is used to clear the hit count of specified nodes.

- Parameters:
    - `nodes: string[]`: A list of node names to clear. Required.
    - `strict?: bool`: Whether the current Action returns a failure if clearing any node fails. Default is `false`.

Example file: [`ClearHitCount.json`](../../../assets/resource/pipeline/Interface/Example/ClearHitCount.json)

### FalseAction

The `FalseAction` implementation is located in `agent/go-service/common/falseaction` and always returns a failure. It is commonly used as a placeholder in Pipelines where an Action needs to be forced to fail.

- Parameters: None.

### FocusOCRAction

The `FocusOCRAction` implementation is located in `agent/go-service/common/focusocr`. It takes a screenshot, runs a Pipeline recognition node, picks the first OCR text, and prints it via `maafocus`.

Parameters:

- `node: string`: Required. Pipeline recognition node name (OCR, or an `And` whose `box_index` points at OCR).
- `focus: string`: Optional. `maafocus` message. `%s` is the OCR text, e.g. `Current sanity: %s`. If omitted, the raw text is printed.

Example file: [`FocusOCRAction.json`](../../../assets/resource/pipeline/Interface/Example/FocusOCRAction.json)

```json
{
    "action": {
        "type": "Custom",
        "param": {
            "custom_action": "FocusOCRAction",
            "custom_action_param": {
                "node": "CommonSanityText",
                "focus": "Current sanity: %s"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

The node's own recognition still belongs in Pipeline for routing. This Action only screenshots, recognizes, and reports after the node hits.

### RepeatUntilFoundAction / RepeatUntilNotFoundAction

Both are implemented in `agent/go-service/common/repeataction`. They repeatedly run a built-in or custom action, then poll recognition inside a wait window. They succeed when the wait condition is met, and fail after `repeat_count` attempts without success.

- `RepeatUntilFoundAction`: succeeds when **any** `wait_nodes` entry hits.
- `RepeatUntilNotFoundAction`: succeeds when `wait_node` misses.

- Shared parameters:
    - `action: string`: Built-in action type (e.g. `Click`). Mutually exclusive with `custom_action`.
    - `custom_action?: string`: Registered custom action name (e.g. `AutoAltClickAction`). Mutually exclusive with `action`.
    - `custom_action_param?: object`: Forwarded to the nested custom action.
    - `repeat_count?: int`: Maximum attempts. Defaults to `3` when omitted or `<= 0`.
    - `interval_ms?: int`: Wait window after each action, in milliseconds. Within the window, screencap/recognize every `500ms` and succeed early on a hit. Defaults to `3000` when omitted or `0`. Negative values are invalid.
- `RepeatUntilFoundAction` extra:
    - `wait_nodes: string[]`: Pipeline node names to wait for. Required.
- `RepeatUntilNotFoundAction` extra:
    - `wait_node: string`: Single Pipeline node name to wait until it disappears. Required.

The target position always uses the recognition `box` that triggered this Action (optionally adjusted by outer `target` / `target_offset`). The loop aborts immediately and returns failure when the tasker reports stopping.

Example file: [`RepeatUntilFoundAction.json`](../../../assets/resource/pipeline/Interface/Example/RepeatUntilFoundAction.json)

### CharacterSearchAction

`CharacterSearchAction` lives in `agent/go-service/common/charactercontroller`. When an interact point cannot be found, it walks a fixed WASD circle to fine-tune position and recognize target nodes. See [CharacterController reference](./components/character-controller.md#action-charactersearchaction) for parameters and path details.

Example file: [`CharacterController.json`](../../../assets/resource/pipeline/Interface/Example/CharacterController.json)

### CameraScanAction

`CameraScanAction` lives in `agent/go-service/common/camerascan`. It moves the camera in discrete steps while recognizing targets in photo mode. The action scans the forward area in a center-out nine-grid spiral, then resets the camera and performs discrete yaw rings at middle, upper, and lower pitch levels. It recognizes before and after every camera movement except reset, succeeds when any target hits, and fails after the complete scan misses.

- `wait_nodes: string[]`: Pipeline recognition nodes checked before and after every camera movement. Required; any hit succeeds. Reset movements are not checked.
- `aim_target?: bool`: Whether to swipe from the screen center to the hit recognition result's `Box` center before returning. Defaults to `false`.
- `move_up?: string`: Node for one upward camera step. Defaults to `__CameraScanMoveUp`.
- `move_down?: string`: Node for one downward camera step. Defaults to `__CameraScanMoveDown`.
- `move_left?: string`: Node for one leftward camera step. Defaults to `__CameraScanMoveLeft`.
- `move_right?: string`: Node for one rightward camera step. Defaults to `__CameraScanMoveRight`.
- `fallback_yaw_steps?: int`: Discrete yaw movements in each fallback ring. Defaults to `8`; range `[4, 72]`.

Camera movement runs through `ctx.RunTask` on the corresponding direction nodes (defaults in `Common/Private/CameraScan/Action.json`). Configure `post_wait_freezes` on caller-provided direction nodes when the screen must settle after each move. Aiming still uses the private node `__CameraScanAimSwipe`.

### PipelineOverride

The `PipelineOverride` implementation is located in `agent/go-service/common/pipelineoverride` and is used at runtime to merge **node-organized partial JSON** into the Pipeline. By default it uses `ctx.OverridePipeline` (current task only); resource-level override is optional. It is suitable for dynamically toggling node switches or adjusting recognition/action parameters **without changing the static flow topology**.

- Parameters:
    - `patch: object`: Required. Keys are **node names**, and values are the **partial override objects** for those nodes. Semantics are consistent with MaaFramework's `OverridePipeline`: same-named nodes are merged, same-named fields are overwritten.
    - `allow_next?: bool`: Whether to allow partial node objects to contain top-level `next`. Default is `false`; when `false`, `next` will be removed from each patch item before application to avoid runtime modification of the preset topology.
    - `strict?: bool`: When `allow_next` is `false`, if a patch still contains `next`, whether to immediately report an error and fail. Default is `false` (will remove `next` and log it); if `true`, the current Action fails immediately and no overrides are applied. If `allow_next` is `true`, `strict` is ignored and treated as `false`.
    - `resource_override?: bool`: Whether to apply a resource-level override (`Resource.OverridePipeline`). Default is `false` (Context / current-task scope); when `true`, node definitions on the bound Resource are rewritten and later tasks sharing that Resource are affected—evaluate side effects carefully.

Usage Recommendations:

- Prioritize deciding the strategy at the **process entry point**; if adjustments are necessary midway, try to only modify fields like `enabled`, recognizer parameters, and action parameters. Avoid arbitrarily changing the `next` graph structure.
- If runtime modification of `next` is genuinely required, explicitly set `allow_next: true` and self-assess the debugging and regression costs; it should be kept off by default.
- Keep `resource_override: false` by default; enable it only when a cross-task / global node rewrite is truly required.
- For troubleshooting, use in conjunction with additional log or screenshot nodes.
- Runtime logs only record non-sensitive metadata such as node count, node names, and parameter length; they do not output the complete `custom_action_param` or patch content, which may contain sensitive information like credentials and tokens.

Example file: [`PipelineOverride.json`](../../../assets/resource/pipeline/Interface/Example/PipelineOverride.json)

### AttachToExpectedRegexAction

The `AttachToExpectedRegexAction` implementation is located in `agent/go-service/common/attachregex`. It is used to generically read keywords from the target node's own `attach` and write the merged allowlist regex back to the target OCR node's `expected`.

- Parameters:
    - `target: string`: The target node name (which will have its `expected` overwritten). Required.

Processing Rules:

- `attach` supports both `string` and `string[]` value types; it automatically trims whitespace, deduplicates, and applies regex escaping.
- When the keyword list is empty, `a^` (equivalent to "never match") is generated.
- The final merged regex overrides the target node's `expected` via `OverridePipeline`.

Example:

```json
{
    "action": "Custom",
    "custom_action": "AttachToExpectedRegexAction",
    "custom_action_param": {
        "target": "Priority2OCR"
    }
}
```

Compatibility Notes:

- The Credit Shop has been switched to directly use `AttachToExpectedRegexAction`.
- If multiple target nodes need to be overridden, it is recommended to split them into multiple `Custom` nodes in the Pipeline and link them via `next`.
- If multiple nodes require the same allowlist, the same `attach` should be written into their respective nodes in the task configuration.
- Other tasks are also recommended to use the generic name to avoid coupling with specific business logic.

### PostStop

The `PostStop` implementation is located in `agent/go-service/common/poststop`. It calls `Tasker.PostStop()` to asynchronously stop the current task. It is suitable for scenarios where a condition in the Pipeline requires actively terminating the entire task.

- Parameters: None.

### AutoAltClickAction

The `AutoAltClickAction` implementation is located in `agent/go-service/common/autoalt`. It performs an Alt + Click operation at a specified position. It first presses the Alt key, clicks the target position, and then releases the Alt key.

- Parameters:
    - `target_offset?: [int, int, int, int]`: Optional. Format like `[dx, dy, dw, dh]`, overlaid onto `box` before clicking the center; semantics are consistent with the `target_offset` of the built-in `Click` action. If omitted, it directly clicks the center of `box`.

The default target position is determined by the `box` of the Pipeline node.

### AutoCtrlClickAction

`AutoCtrlClickAction` is implemented alongside `AutoAltClickAction` in `agent/go-service/common/autoalt`. It performs Ctrl + Click at a specified position. Pressing Ctrl, clicking, and releasing Ctrl all run through Pipeline child nodes, allowing platform resources to override the corresponding key codes. It still attempts to release Ctrl when pressing or clicking fails.

- Parameters: None.

The target position is determined by the Pipeline node's `box` and can be adjusted with the outer `target` / `target_offset` fields.

### AutoAltSwipeAction

The `AutoAltSwipeAction` implementation is located in `agent/go-service/common/autoalt`. It performs an Alt + Swipe operation. It first presses the Alt key, executes the swipe, and then releases the Alt key.

- Parameters (all optional, passed through to the Swipe action of the child node `__AutoAltSwipeMouseSwipeAction`):
    - `begin?: [int, int] | [int, int, int, int]`: Swipe start point; defaults to `arg.Box` if omitted.
    - `end?: [int, int] | [int, int, int, int]`: Swipe end point; defaults to `arg.Box` if omitted.
    - `begin_offset?: [int, int, int, int]`: Overlays `[dx, dy, dw, dh]` onto the default start point (`arg.Box`).
    - `end_offset?: [int, int, int, int]`: Overlays `[dx, dy, dw, dh]` onto the default end point (`arg.Box`).
    - `duration?: int`: Swipe duration in milliseconds.
    - `end_hold?: int`: Hold duration after the swipe ends in milliseconds.
    - `only_hover?: bool`: Whether to only hover swipe.

---

## Custom Recognition

Recognition nodes are used to execute custom recognition. A common format is as follows:

```json
{
    "recognition": {
        "type": "Custom",
        "param": {
            "custom_recognition": "SomeRecognition",
            "custom_recognition_param": {
                "foo": "bar"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

- `custom_recognition`: The registration name.
- `custom_recognition_param`: An arbitrary JSON value, serialized by the framework and passed to the implementation side.
- Returns `true` to indicate a match; returns `false` to indicate no match.

### ExpressionRecognition

The `ExpressionRecognition` implementation is located in `agent/go-service/common/expressionrecognition`. It is used to evaluate boolean expressions composed of numerical recognition nodes.

Parameters:

- `expression: string`: Required. The expression must ultimately evaluate to a boolean value.
- `box_node?: string`: Optional. Which recognition node's result box to return upon a match; if the node is `And`, it will first execute that node, then read the corresponding sub-recognition result's box directly from the current recognition results based on its native `box_index`.

Placeholder Rules:

- Use `{NodeName}` to reference other recognition nodes.
- Referenced nodes are executed once with the current image `arg.Img`.
- If a referenced node is `And`, the current implementation first executes the `And` node itself, then reads the corresponding sub-recognition result directly from the current recognition results based on that node's native `box_index`, and treats it as the final source for that node's value.
- The current implementation extracts numerical values from the referenced node's OCR results to participate in the calculation and supports common abbreviation formats, such as `1.38万`, `13.8K`, `22.01M`; these values are converted to integers before participating in the expression calculation.

Supported Operations:

- Arithmetic: `+` `-` `*` `/` `%`
- Comparison: `<` `<=` `>` `>=` `==` `!=`
- Logical: `&&` `||` `!`
- Grouping: `(...)`

Example:

```json
{
    "recognition": {
        "type": "Custom",
        "param": {
            "custom_recognition": "ExpressionRecognition",
            "custom_recognition_param": {
                "expression": "{CreditShoppingReserveCreditOCRInternal}<{ReserveCreditThreshold}",
                "box_node": "CreditShoppingReserveCreditOCRInternal"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Another example:

- `{CurrentCredit}<300`
- `{CurrentCredit}-{RefreshCost}<400`
- `({NodeA}+{NodeB})>=100 && {NodeC}==1`

Important Notes:

- The expression result must be a boolean value; otherwise, recognition fails.
- Referenced nodes should currently return a parseable OCR numerical result; otherwise, expression evaluation fails.
- For `And` nodes, the sub-recognition result pointed to by `box_index` currently needs to directly contain a parseable OCR numerical result.
- Integer literals in expressions, and values converted from OCR, if they exceed the range representable by the platform's `int`, are automatically clamped to the `int` maximum or minimum (positive overflow takes the maximum, negative overflow takes the minimum), and a warning log is output; expression evaluation continues rather than failing immediately.
- This recognizer is only responsible for expression evaluation, not for the business semantics itself; the business side should organize nodes and thresholds within the Pipeline.
- For the same kind of boolean expression over **IMS cached item quantities**, use IMS R1 `ItemQuantitySatisfied` (`{ITEM_ID}` placeholders; see [IMS docs](./components/ims.md#r1-itemquantitysatisfied)). Do not pass item IDs to this recognizer.

### ListCompleteRecognition

The `ListCompleteRecognition` implementation is located in `agent/go-service/common/listcomplete`. It detects whether a list has **already reached the end** by comparing template similarity in a given region.

**Hit semantics: `true` = list complete; `false` = not complete yet (keep scrolling).**

Parameters:

- Native `roi: [x, y, w, h]`: Optional. Recognition region at 720p; defaults to fullscreen. In V2, put it inside `recognition.param` alongside `custom_recognition` (not inside `custom_recognition_param`).
- `custom_recognition_param.threshold: number`: Optional, default `0.9`. TemplateMatch threshold; score `>= threshold` means the region is unchanged (list complete) and the recognition hits.

Behavior:

1. Read `attach.ready` from the current custom recognition node.
2. If `ready` is false (first run): crop the native `roi`, write it via `OverrideImage` as `ListCompleteRecognition/<current-node>.png`, set `attach.ready` to `true`, and return **no match** (cannot decide complete yet).
3. If already ready: run `TemplateMatch` against that template inside the same `roi`.
4. Score `>= threshold`: treat the list as complete and return a **match**.
5. Score below threshold: recapture and `OverrideImage`, then return **no match** (keep scrolling).

Pipeline layout: place this recognition **before** the swipe node; on hit take the "complete" branch, on miss fall through to swipe. The swipe node must set `post_wait_freezes`.

Example file: [`ListCompleteRecognition.json`](../../../assets/resource/pipeline/Interface/Example/ListCompleteRecognition.json)

```json
{
    "ExampleScan": {
        "next": [
            "ExampleComplete",
            "[JumpBack]ExampleScroll"
        ]
    },
    "ExampleComplete": {
        "recognition": {
            "type": "Custom",
            "param": {
                "custom_recognition": "ListCompleteRecognition",
                "custom_recognition_param": {
                    "threshold": 0.9
                },
                "roi": [480, 160, 320, 400]
            }
        },
        "action": "DoNothing",
        "attach": {
            "ready": false
        },
        "next": ["ExampleDone"]
    },
    "ExampleScroll": {
        "recognition": "DirectHit",
        "action": "Swipe",
        "begin": [650, 470],
        "end": [650, 150],
        "post_wait_freezes": 200
    }
}
```

Notes:

- **The screen must already be still when recognition runs.** This recognizer compares the current frame with the template captured on the previous round. If inertia, bounce, or transition animation is still running when the next recognition starts, the region keeps changing, so completion cannot be decided and scrolling continues. Put `post_wait_freezes` on the **swipe node** (optionally with a `target` ROI over the list area) so the frame freezes before returning to scan/recognition.
- State is stored in `attach.ready` on the **current Custom recognition node**; the runtime template is kept by `OverrideImage` and is not written to disk.
- To restart a list scan, set that Custom node's `attach.ready` to `false` (for example via `PipelineOverride`).
- This recognizer only answers "is the list complete"; scrolling/clicking still belong in Pipeline.

### ScrollbarRecognition

`ScrollbarRecognition` lives in `agent/go-service/common/listcomplete`. It detects the scrollbar's white thumb and returns its position and length. This recognizer is stateless and does not read or write `attach`; use it when a Pipeline or Custom component needs the thumb region, current position, or length.

**Hit semantics: `true` = a valid thumb was found; `false` = no valid thumb was found.**

Parameters:

- Native `roi: [x, y, w, h]`: Required. A narrow 720p region covering only the scrollbar track. In V2, put it inside `recognition.param` alongside `custom_recognition`.
- No `custom_recognition_param` parameters.

Output:

- `Box`: The absolute 720p thumb region `[roi.x, roi.y + top, roi.width, length]`, suitable as a target for subsequent actions or recognitions.
- `Detail`: A JSON object where `top` and `bottom` are relative to the ROI top and `length = bottom - top + 1`.

```json
{
    "top": 9,
    "bottom": 31,
    "length": 23
}
```

Both scrollbar recognizers share the same detector: search each ROI row for a pixel where `min(R, G, B) >= 200`, fill internal gaps up to 2 rows, and select the longest continuous segment whose length is at least 5px.

```json
{
    "ExampleScrollbar": {
        "recognition": {
            "type": "Custom",
            "param": {
                "custom_recognition": "ScrollbarRecognition",
                "roi": [
                    1119,
                    220,
                    5,
                    255
                ]
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### ScrollbarCompleteRecognition

`ScrollbarCompleteRecognition` lives in the same package as `ScrollbarRecognition` and reuses the same internal thumb detector. It stores and compares consecutive positions on top of that basic result, making it suitable for top/bottom detection when list content or backgrounds change and a full-region template comparison is not stable.

**Hit semantics: `true` = the scrollbar did not move, or no scrollbar was detected twice consecutively, so the list is at the top, bottom, or is not scrollable; `false` = completion cannot be determined yet (keep scrolling).**

Parameters:

- Native `roi: [x, y, w, h]`: Required. A narrow 720p region covering only the scrollbar track. In V2, put it inside `recognition.param` alongside `custom_recognition`, not inside `custom_recognition_param`.
- `custom_recognition_param.position_tolerance: integer`: Optional, default `2`, minimum `0`. The recognition hits when both the top and bottom thumb boundaries differ from the previous recorded position by no more than this many 720p pixels. `0` requires exact agreement for both boundaries.

Behavior:

1. Use the same internal detector as `ScrollbarRecognition` to obtain `[top, bottom]`.
2. On the first recognition or after the thumb moves, write the boundaries to `attach.scrollbar_top` / `attach.scrollbar_bottom` on the current node, set `attach.ready` to `true`, and return **no match**.
3. On later recognitions, return a **match** only when both boundaries are within `position_tolerance`; otherwise update the stored position and return **no match**.
4. The first missing valid white segment records `attach.scrollbar_missing = true` and returns **no match**, allowing the Pipeline to perform one confirmation scroll. If the next observation is also missing, return a **match** and treat the list as not scrollable. Detecting a valid thumb later clears the missing state.

The Pipeline layout is the same as for `ListCompleteRecognition`: put this recognition before the scroll node; a hit takes the "boundary reached" branch, while a miss falls through to scrolling. The scroll node must set `post_wait_freezes` so the next recognition runs only after the frame is still.

```json
{
    "ExampleScrollbarComplete": {
        "recognition": {
            "type": "Custom",
            "param": {
                "custom_recognition": "ScrollbarCompleteRecognition",
                "custom_recognition_param": {
                    "position_tolerance": 2
                },
                "roi": [
                    1119,
                    220,
                    5,
                    255
                ]
            }
        },
        "attach": {
            "ready": false
        }
    }
}
```

Notes:

- The ROI should cover only the scrollbar track. White text or icons in the list may otherwise form a longer continuous segment.
- The first call only records a thumb position or missing observation and cannot determine completion. Before a fresh list scan, reset `attach.ready` on the current node to `false` through `PipelineOverride`; this also starts a new missing-confirmation cycle.
- The component does not distinguish "top" from "bottom"; that meaning comes from the Pipeline's current scroll direction.
- The component only detects the list boundary. Scrolling and subsequent business flow still belong in Pipeline.

### ExpendableRecognition

The `ExpendableRecognition` implementation is located in `agent/go-service/common/expendable`. It implements one-shot consumption of list items (visit once, then exclude via `attach.visited`), such as unread event-center entries or friends in a visit list.

Parameters:

- `candidate: string`: Required. An `OCR` node, or an `And` whose `box_index` points at the text OCR. Only that named OCR is patched; the candidate hit box is returned for `Click`.
- `visited_node: string`: Optional. Read/write `attach.visited` on this node instead of the current Custom node. Multiple consumable nodes can share one blacklist (e.g. remark-first + any-friend).
- `key_regex: string`: Optional. Extract the visited key from OCR text (capture group 1 if present, otherwise the full match; fall back to the raw text on no match). Without it, behavior matches the original exact full-string store/exclude. With it, the blacklist also tolerates non-digit OCR tail noise after the key. Game-specific rules (e.g. cut remark names at the first `)`, cut normal names at `#UID`) stay in Pipeline.

Behavior:

1. Load `attach.visited` from `visited_node` (or the current Custom node).
2. Resolve the key OCR from `candidate` (`And.box_index`), read its `expected`, rebuild a negative blacklist from `visited`, and override only `expected` (`order_by` and other fields stay as-is).
3. Run `candidate`; miss means no match.
4. Extract OCR text from the hit; if `key_regex` is set, derive the key first, then append to that node's `attach.visited`, and return the hit box.

Candidate layout, click target, remark priority (multi `expected` + `order_by: Expected`, or two consumable nodes + shared `visited_node`), and how OCR text becomes a key stay in Pipeline.

Example file: [`ExpendableRecognition.json`](../../../assets/resource/pipeline/Interface/Example/ExpendableRecognition.json)

```json
{
    "recognition": {
        "type": "Custom",
        "param": {
            "custom_recognition": "ExpendableRecognition",
            "custom_recognition_param": {
                "candidate": "SomeCandidateAnd",
                "key_regex": ".*?[)）]"
            }
        }
    },
    "attach": {
        "visited": []
    }
}
```

Notes:

- State lives in `attach.visited` on `visited_node` (default: the current Custom recognition node).
- Clear that node's `attach.visited` before a fresh scan (task re-entry or `PipelineOverride`).
- `expected` on key OCR nodes is fully replaced with "base patterns + visited blacklist"; bases come from the node before override (previous exclusion prefixes are stripped).
- Key OCR leaves must be **named node refs** (`And.box_index` must not point at an inline OCR object).
- `key_regex` only runs caller-declared truncation; the shared component never embeds game-specific copy rules.

### ScheduleRecognition

The `ScheduleRecognition` implementation is located in `agent/go-service/common/schedule`. It is used to determine whether the current task should continue executing based on the day of the week. It only returns whether recognition matches; it does not directly run subtasks in Go; subsequent flows should be organized via the Pipeline's `next`.

- Parameters: None.
- `attach` field (written in the current recognition node, can be merged in the task configuration):
    - `monday: bool` — Whether to execute on Monday.
    - `tuesday: bool` — Whether to execute on Tuesday.
    - `wednesday: bool` — Whether to execute on Wednesday.
    - `thursday: bool` — Whether to execute on Thursday.
    - `friday: bool` — Whether to execute on Friday.
    - `saturday: bool` — Whether to execute on Saturday.
    - `sunday: bool` — Whether to execute on Sunday.

When a weekday flag is omitted, it defaults to `false` (do not execute that day). If the current day is not within the scheduling range, this Recognition emits a localized prompt "Skipping today" and returns no match.

## Summary

When writing a Pipeline, the built-in `TemplateMatch` / `OCR` / `Click` / `Swipe` can handle most needs. When they fall short—for example, comparing two OCR values, dynamically adjusting parameters at runtime, or batch running subtasks—then refer to this document to see if there's an existing Custom action or recognition to use.

| Scenario | Use |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Run a series of subtasks in order | `SubTask` |
| Clear hit count of a node | `ClearHitCount` |
| Force an Action to fail | `FalseAction` |
| Screenshot then report Pipeline OCR | `FocusOCRAction` |
| Repeat an action until a node appears | `RepeatUntilFoundAction` |
| Repeat an action until a node disappears | `RepeatUntilNotFoundAction` |
| Actively stop the current task | `PostStop` |
| Change node parameters at runtime | `PipelineOverride` |
| Write keywords as regex back to OCR node | `AttachToExpectedRegexAction` |
| Evaluate OCR numerical expressions | `ExpressionRecognition` |
| Detect list completion by region template | `ListCompleteRecognition` |
| Get the scrollbar thumb position and length | `ScrollbarRecognition` |
| Detect a list top or bottom by scrollbar position | `ScrollbarCompleteRecognition` |
| Consumable pick (visited exclusion) | `ExpendableRecognition` |
| Gate subsequent nodes by day of week | `ScheduleRecognition` |
| Alt + Click at specified position | `AutoAltClickAction` |
| Ctrl + Click at specified position | `AutoCtrlClickAction` |
| Alt + Swipe | `AutoAltSwipeAction` |

All Custom Go code implementations are located under `agent/go-service/`. Pipeline authors do not need to concern themselves with this; just write the JSON according to the documentation parameters.
